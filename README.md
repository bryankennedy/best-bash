# A first pass at sharing my bash environment

## Instalation
1. Put this folder in `~/.dotfiles/best-bash` and `cd` to the directory.

```
        cd ~/.dotfiles/best-bash
```
2. Run the install.sh script. **This will backup your home dir bash files and replace them with symlinks to the best-bash system.**

```
        ./install.sh
```
